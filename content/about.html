            The fresh aroma of masalas being made reminds me of my childhood. Every summer, 
            traditional families had a ritual of making their masalas that were to be stored and 
            used for the entire year. Those were the days of joint families, a very foreign concept 
            for us now. Summer was a perfect time as there was plenty of sunshine and spreading all 
            the whole spices in large quantities, on a cotton or muslin cloth in the sun to dry the 
            spices was easy. Those spices were then cleaned of any debris and mixed in different 
            proportions to be then pounded into powders known as "masalas". These were stored in 
            large clay pot containers , and usually lasted for a whole year. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Different regions from India use different proportions of whole spices to make these 
            masalas. Some masalas are famous from certain States of India. Garam Masala is the most 
            common and well known of the Indian spice blends.  I grew up watching my mother making 
            her own masalas at home and the aromas were amazing, and would enliven my senses. As I 
            started making my own masalas, I realized that there is so much more to the art of 
            making masalas than just randomly throwing a few whole spices together and grinding them
            to add to a dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to offer my spice blend and masalas for cooking enthusiasts 
            originally but realized that they would be so useful for working couples, singles and 
            students to put together flavorful meals quickly without too much fuss. I hope you enjoy
            our line of masalas and spice blends as much as we have in our family.
